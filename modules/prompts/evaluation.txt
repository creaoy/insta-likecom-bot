Story description
===
 The image shows a screenshot of an Instagram story interface. At the center of the image is a black vertical bar with a small white circle at its top. Below this bar, there is a white space that seems to be an area for adding text or other content, and it currently has placeholder text in Italian, "Ciao, come stai?"

The background color of the story interface is a dark brown, which is typical for Instagram's design. The top of the screenshot includes the interface elements such as the story camera button on the left, the add text or tag option on the right, and the viewer profile picture at the top right corner. The bottom of the image shows the phone's status bar with a signal strength indicator and time information, but these details are not entirely clear.
